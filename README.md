# Marco Estors 
I'm a Front End Developer Junior born in Spain, who lived in the UK (London, Weymouth, Ballater and Glasgow), from 2008 to 2016. <br>
Living in Glasgow I decided to study again, started preparing myself to access to University. <br>
I started studying Mathematics, English Grammar and Object Oriented Java Programming online, until the year 2015 in which I was accepted to study a Higher National Diploma (HND), at City of Glasgow College. <br>
After finishing my first year in College studying Front End Development and Design, I received an HNC (Higher National Certificate), equivalent to a Bachelor's Degree first year). <br> 
I dropped out of College at the beginning of the second year (Back End Development), because I lived 8 years in a row in the UK and wanted to go back to Spain. <br>

Now I want to live abroad again but this time permanently in the UK, the European Union or the United States

* To reduce the size of images before exporting them. <br>

### HTML5 
* To create the website structure, according to the W3C standards.
* uploading the markup to  www.validator.w3.org http://www.validator.w3.org/ to check and correct errors or warnings. 

### CSS
* To create accurate pixel perfect or fluid prototypes or websites.
* To change the appearance of the elements dynamically using transitions or keyframes animations. 
* Mobile First.
* Media Queries. 
* Flexbox.

### SASS  
* To load websites faster by importing all files into a main file, so it makes only 1 http request.

### JAVASCRIPT 
* **Basic**: Variables, Data Types, Conditionals, Functions, Objects, DOM.

### BOOTSTRAP
* **Bootstrap 3 (Experience 2015-2018)**  <br>
It was hot at that time, so I decided to be good at it. I used to hand coding Bootstrap navs, carousels, modals. <br>
I ended up creating my own snippets in json files. <br>

* **Bootstrap 4 (Experience 2018-2019)** <br> 
It comes with SCSS and Flexbox out of the box, and I was using SCSS and Flexbox with Bootstrap 3 already. 

<br>

## What is next?
I just want to code.
If nothing happened I would learn React/Vue JS, but I the right offer came up, I would specialize in any other programming language <br> 
Java, C++, C#, anything really
