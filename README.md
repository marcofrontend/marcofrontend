# Marco Estors
I'm a Front End Developer Junior born in Spain.
While living in Glasgow, I decided to study again. My First course about programming was: M250 - Object-Oriented Java Programming (Open University). It was great, and I learnt a lot. objects, classes, setters, getters, abstract classes, interfaces... I was really into it. <br> I was also studying online courses to become an Oracle Certified Professional Java Developer. <br>
I switched to JavaScript, and I went to College in Glasgow. (HND Interactive Media - Web Development) 
I dropped out of the second year, but I got the HNC Web Development Certificate.

## My Workflow

### Photoshop

* To create Website Layouts with or without using bootstrap grids.
* To convert psd design into HTML5 and CSS. <br> 
* To reduce the size of images before exporting them. <br>

### HTML5 
* To create the website structure, according to the W3C standards.
* uploading the markup to  www.validator.w3.org http://www.validator.w3.org/ to check and correct errors or warnings. 

### CSS
* To create an accurate pixel perfect or fluid prototype or website.
* To change the appearance of the elements dynamically using transitions or keyframes animations. 
* Mobile First.
* Media Queries. 
* Flexbox.

### SASS  
* To load a website faster by importing all files into the main file  so it makes only 1 http request. 
* To organize website content like variables, typography, layout and components.

### JAVASCRIPT 
* **DOM Manipulation**: I don't use JQuery anymore, it can be done with Vanilla JS
* **Advanced Object Oriented JavaScript**: Literal Objects, Functions, Arrays
* **ES6 Features**: Arrow Functions, Template Literals, String Literals, Destructuring, Maps, Sets, Promises, <br> 
Prototypes, Inheritance, Classes, Loops (forEach, for-in, for-of)
  
### BOOTSTRAP
Bootstrap 3 (**Experience 2015-2018**)  <br>
It was hot at that time, so I decided to be good at it. I used to hand coding Bootstrap navs, carousels, modals. <br>
I ended up creating my own snippets in json files. <br>

Bootstrap 4 (**Experience 2018-2019**) <br> 
It comes with SCSS and Flexbox out of the box, and I was using SCSS and Flexbox with Bootstrap 3 already. 

<br>

## What is next?
I just want to code.
If nothing happened I would learn React/Vue JS, but I the right offer came up, I would specialize in any other programming language <br> 
Java, C++, C#, anything really

<br>

## What you will find:
- CV made in 2018
- Responsive Website demo 1
- Responsive Website demo 2
- 20 designs I made using Photoshop
