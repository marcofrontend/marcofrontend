# Marco Estors
I'm a Front End Developer Junior born in Spain.
While living in Glasgow, I decided to study again. My First course about programming was: M250 - Object-Oriented Java Programming (Open University). It was great, and I learnt a lot. objects, classes, setters, getters, abstract classes, interfaces... I was really into it. <br> I was also studying online courses to become an Oracle Certified Professional Java Developer. <br>
I switched to JavaScript, and I went to College in Glasgow. (HND Interactive Media - Web Development) 
I dropped out of the second year, but I got the HNC Web Development Certificate. 

## Interested in finding a job as a Junior Web Developer

**BOOTSTRAP**
- Bootstrap 3 (Experience 2015-2018)  
- It was hot at that time, so I decided to be good at it. I used Bootstrap hand coding navs, carousels, modals.. 

- Bootstrap 4 (Experience 2018-2019) - 1 year ago I don't use it, but I love it. It uses scss and flexbox out of the box, and I was using SCSS and Flexbox with Bootstrap 3 already.
