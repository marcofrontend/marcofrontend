Bootstrap 3 (Experience 2015-2018)  
It was hot at that time, so I decided to be good at it. I used Bootstrap hand coding navs, carousels, modals.. 

Bootstrap 4 (Experience 2018-2019) - 
1 year ago I don't use it, but I love it. It uses scss and flexbox out of the box, and I was using SCSS and Flexbox with Bootstrap 3 already. 

## What is next?
- I just want to code. 
- If nothing happened I would learn React/Vue JS, but I the right offer came up, I would specialize in any other programming language
- Java, C++, C#, anything really

## What you will find:
- CV made in 2018
- Responsive Website demo 1
- Responsive Website demo 2
- 20 designs I made using Photoshop
- 3 Responsive Websites (Mobile First I build in 2020)
